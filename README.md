# Predicting Burnout in Nurses Using Synthetic Data and Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict burnout in nurses using synthetic data generated by AI and advanced statistical analysis techniques. By leveraging artificial data and predictive modeling, we seek to identify key factors contributing to nurse burnout and develop strategies for prevention.

## Key Features
1. Synthetic data generation using generative AI
2. Comprehensive statistical analysis
3. Predictive modeling for nurse burnout
4. Identification of key burnout factors
5. Development of prevention strategies

## Data Generation
- Utilized generative AI to create a synthetic dataset mimicking real-world nurse burnout scenarios
- Generated data includes various factors such as:
  - Demographic information
  - Work hours and shift patterns
  - Patient load
  - Workplace environment factors
  - Stress levels
  - Job satisfaction indicators
  - Burnout scores

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. Cleaning and structuring the synthetic dataset
2. Handling any inconsistencies or anomalies in the generated data
3. Feature engineering to create relevant variables for analysis

### Statistical Analysis
1. Descriptive statistics to understand data distribution
2. Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables
3. Hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about burnout factors

### Predictive Modeling
Implemented various statistical and machine learning models:
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. Gradient Boosting Machines

### Model Evaluation
Metrics used for evaluation:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)
- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) for classification models

## Key Findings

1. Top predictors of nurse burnout
2. Unexpected correlations discovered
3. Effectiveness of different models in predicting burnout

## Prevention Strategies

1. Optimizing shift schedules
2. Implementing stress management programs
3. Improving workplace environment factors

## Technologies Used
- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization


## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script for step-by-step analysis

## Future Work
- Validate findings with real-world data
- Develop a more sophisticated burnout prediction model
- Create a web application for real-time burnout risk assessment


This project demonstrates the application of synthetic data and statistical analysis in addressing the critical issue of nurse burnout, potentially contributing to improved healthcare workforce management and patient care outcomes.
